# Activity Library

Now I finally have time again to work on this.
I always wanted to create something like it.
I hope I can release a solid simple version in near future ofr everyone to use.

This library will concise out of many modules and i will try to keep them as seperate and as modular as possible.

This system should in the end be just a simple framework defining interfaces, coding rules and how things should interact.
It might not even include implementations but rather recommondations which implementations to use.

Let me know if you have one and Ill reference it in the library.
